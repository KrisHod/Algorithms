Test2
 
Given two strings, one is a subsequence if all of the elements of the first string occur in the same order within the second string. 
They do not have to be contiguous in the second string but order must be maintained. 
For example, given the string "I like cheese", the words "I cheese" are a subsequence of that string.   
Words are space delimited.

Test3

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.

answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.

answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.

answer[i] == i if non of the above conditions are true.
