Practice Coding Challenges

Test1

Maximum Possible Value

Write a function solution that, given an integer N, returns the maximum possible value obtained by inserting one '5' digit inside the decimal representation of integer N.
****************

Test2
 
Given two strings, one is a subsequence if all of the elements of the first string occur in the same order within the second string. 
They do not have to be contiguous in the second string but order must be maintained. 
For example, given the string "I like cheese", the words "I cheese" are a subsequence of that string.   
Words are space delimited.

Function Paramete
You are given a function missingWords that takes the strings S and T as its arguments.

 
Function Return Value

Return an array of the missing words.

 
Sample Input

I am using hackerrank to improve programming

Sample Output

I

programming
***************

Test3

Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:

answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.

answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.

answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.

answer[i] == i if non of the above conditions are true.
****************

Test4

Math Challenge
Have the function MathChallenge(num) take the num parameter being passed which will always be a positive integer and return its additive persistence which is the number of times you must add the digits in num until you reach a single digit. 

For example: if num is 2718 then your program should return 2 because 2+7+1+8 =18 and 1+8 =9.
**************

Test5
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
